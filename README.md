# FPlanck
FPlanck is a Python library for numerically solving the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation (also known as the Smoluchowski equation) in N dimensions using a matrix numerical method:

</p>

The method is based on the paper *"Physically consistent numerical solver for time-dependent Fokker-Planck equations"* by V. Holubec, K. Kroy, and S. Steffenoni, available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01285.pdf) and published in [APS](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.99.032117).

## Features
+ Declare external potentials (conservative) and force fields (non-conservative) in N-dimensions
+ Solve for the steady-state probability distribution and probability currents
+ Propagate any initial probability distribution to the solution at any later time
+ Periodic and reflecting boundary conditions (can be mixed along different dimensions)

## Installation and Usage
```shell
pip install fplanck
```

See the [examples](src/fplanck/examples) folder for how to use FPlanck.

Run any of the available [examples](src/fplanck/examples) without explicit installation using `uv`:

| Command | Description |

| `uvx fplanck free_space` | Free diffusion in 1D with periodic boundary conditions |
| `uvx fplanck harmonic` | 1D harmonic potential with time evolution |
| `uvx fplanck harmonic_2d` | 2D harmonic potential showing restoration to equilibrium |
| `uvx fplanck periodic` | Particle in a periodic cosine potential with reflecting boundaries |
| `uvx fplanck ratchet` | Tilted periodic potential (Brownian ratchet) with periodic boundaries |
| `uvx fplanck ring` | 2D particle driven by non-conservative force field in a ring pattern |
| `uvx fplanck nonuniform_diffusion` | Position-dependent drag coefficient |
| `uvx fplanck tilted_bigaussian` | Double-well potential with linear tilt |
